Welcome to Comic-cli an object oriented Ruby project for Flatiron School. This gem is made to scrape Mavel Comic's website and show the newest releases. The user can then search in one of the releases and see more info about it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'comic-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install comic-cli

## Usage

To use the program simply run bin/run and it will welcome you and show the most recent comic book releases. The user can then select a number displayed next to the the comic title in the command line to see more info about that comic. The user can then select to see the comic list again or exit program. Typeing 'exit' at anytime ends the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
